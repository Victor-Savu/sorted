# Verified sorting algorithms

This is a library of sorting algorithms that are proven to be correct at compile time.

For a sorting algorithm to be correct, it must take in a list and a relation that induces a linear order over the type of the elements of that list and produce a permutation of the input list that is ordered with respect to the given relation. The algorithm must also terminate on any finite input, but there is currently no bound on the number of comparisons it can make (this definition of correctness does not concern algorithmic complexity).
